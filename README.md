Project: Automated Deployment with Terraform

Description:
This project demonstrates automated deployment using Terraform to provision resources on AWS. It creates an EC2 instance and an S3 bucket named "yeru-1". Additionally, it assigns the S3 bucket to a second EC2 instance named "mc2".

Requirements:
- Terraform installed on your local machine. You can download Terraform from https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html.
- An AWS account with access key ID and secret access key. If you don't have one, sign up for an AWS account at https://aws.amazon.com/.

Activation:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Terraform files.
3. Update the `main.tf` file with your AWS access key ID and secret access key.
4. Optionally, modify the Terraform configuration to customize the resources according to your requirements.
5. Run the following commands in your terminal:
    ```
    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply
    ```
6. After the deployment is complete, you can access the created resources on the AWS Management Console.
7. To clean up the resources and avoid incurring charges, run:
    ```
    terraform destroy
    ```

Note: Make sure to review and understand the changes before applying them, especially if modifying the Terraform configuration for production environments.

For any questions or issues, please refer to the Terraform documentation or contact the project maintainers.
